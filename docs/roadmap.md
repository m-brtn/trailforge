The next stage: tires and deformable terrain. All documentation: [index](README.md).

## Next stage: tires and deformable terrain

1. **Custom tire model.** Replace Jolt's curves with `WheelSettings` + a custom `VehicleController`:
   - a simplified load-dependent brush or Pacejka model;
   - relaxation length to avoid jitter at low speed (slip is currently undefined there);
   - tire pressure as a contact patch stiffness parameter.
2. **Surface fields in `SurfaceProperties`:**
   - Bekker deformation and cohesion moduli (k_c, k_φ, n);
   - cohesion and internal friction angle (Mohr–Coulomb);
   - rolling resistance.
3. **Terrain height field.** A separate `HeightFieldShape` on top of the "hard" proving ground:
   - the wheel presses a rut according to contact patch pressure and compacts the soil;
   - heights are updated in chunks, and collision is rebuilt locally;
   - rendering uses the same height buffer.
4. **Forces.** Bulldozing resistance and wheel sinkage increase motion resistance.
   Traction is limited by soil shear strength (Janosi–Hanamoto), not only by μ.
5. **Drivetrain.** Differential locks as a separate controller mode, axles as linked wheels.
6. **Validation.** Tests for rolling resistance on soft soil, rut depth versus load
   and traction loss under wheelspin.

The tire marks already provide the input for this: `WheelContactSample` carries, per wheel and per tick, the patch
position and normal, load, slip speeds, surface, width and radius. A deformable terrain stage can consume the same
samples (patch pressure = load / (width × patch length)) to write sinkage into the height field instead of a mark
ribbon, and the mark renderer then only has to draw what the height field does not already show.
